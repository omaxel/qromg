# QROMG!
[QROMG](https://omaxel.github.io/qromg) is a QR Code generator with Web GUI.

## Features
This is just the first implementation of what I have in mind. Some of the features I'll add are:
- generate multiple QR Codes from a file;
- add prefix/suffix to specified values (from file) used to generate multiple QR Codes;
- send notification when generation of multiple QR Codes has been completed;
- input validation;
- show error message for not supported browser.

Sure, you can suggest your ideas too :)

## Running locally
Install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
Run development server:
```
yarn start
```
